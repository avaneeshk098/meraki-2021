        <p class="event__about">The word ‘solace’ is derived from a latin word, ‘solacium’ which means “to console”.
            Poetry allows for expression of thought, knowledge, inner-feelings and wisdom. Many write poetry as a means
            to find comfort and to cope with what they are going through. Through expression, we grow.<br><br>
            “Poetry is an echo, asking a shadow to dance.”
            -Carl Sandbury<br><br>
            Many of us often tend to turn to books in times of distress, seeking comfort and warmth in the words.
            Sometimes, we call
            up our friends and talk to them about our grievances, lightening our burden through sharing. Let this poetry
            event
            organized under ‘Meraki Literature Day’ give you a creative and free space to let your words touch our
            hearts!
            With a ticking clock and a theme for you to interpret and write, we give you Inked Solace. Let your words,
            flawless,
            catch our sights!
